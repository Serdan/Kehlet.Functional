# Kehlet.Functional

## Overview
`Kehlet.Functional` is a C# project focused on implementing functional programming constructs. This project provides a range of functionalities that are essential for functional programming paradigms in C#.

## Project Structure

- **Extensions**: Contains extension methods to augment existing classes or types.
- **AutoClosedAttribute.cs**: Defines an attribute for automatic resource management or closures.
- **globals.cs**: Contains global variables or settings for the project.
- **Kehlet.Functional.csproj**: The central project file for build and configuration management.
- **Option.cs**: Implements the 'Option' type, representing values that may or may not exist.
- **OptionUnion.cs**: Defines unions for different states of an 'Option' type.
- **Prelude.cs**: Fundamental functions and types for universal applicability across the project.
- **Result.cs**: Implements the 'Result' type, encapsulating computation outcomes as success or error.
- **ResultUnion.cs**: Defines unions for different outcomes of the 'Result' type.
- **Unit.cs**: Defines the 'Unit' type, representing a semantic-less value in functional programming.

## Functional Programming in C#
This project demonstrates the integration of functional programming concepts within a C# environment, providing a foundation for developers to build upon these concepts in their applications.
